    "\n",
    "Boulder Opal is a versatile Python toolset that provides everything a research team needs to automate and optimize quantum hardware performance at scale for quantum computing and quantum sensing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges of hardware instability, onerous manual tune-up, and increasing complexity with system scaling can dramatically slow down progress.\n",
    "Boulder Opal helps research teams to overcome these challenges and accelerate progress by leveraging five core capabilities based on a powerful discipline called quantum control engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Characterize hardware**:\n",
    "  Identify key system parameters and imperfections for effective calibration, simulation, and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Design error-robust controls**:\n",
    "  Create control solutions to manipulate quantum systems that are resilient to noise and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simulate quantum dynamics**:  \n",
    "  Understand and anticipate the behavior of complex quantum devices under realistic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automate hardware with AI**:\n",
    "  Automate and speed up calibration and optimization with closed-loop agents at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Verify performance**: \n",
    "  Evaluate control solutions to gain insights and ensure effectiveness.\n",
